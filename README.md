This repository contains code supporting the report, [Feasibility of Rainwater Harvesting in Arid Environments](https://native-climate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/RWH-Project-Report-.pdf), by Brianda Hernandez Rosales, published in collaboration with the [Native Waters on Arid Lands](https://nativewaters-aridlands.com) project. The report is based on Bri's 2022 masters thesis in hydrogeology, [Feasibility and Implementation Plan for Rainwater Harvesting in Peach Springs, AZ on the Hualapai Indian Reservation](https://nativewaters-aridlands.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/HernandezRosales_unr_0139M_13750.pdf), and the resulting technical article, [Assessing the Feasibility of Rooftop Rainwater Harvesting for Food Production in Northwestern Arizona on the Hualapai Indian Reservation](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/4/2891).

Rainwater harvesting—the practice of centralizing, collecting, and storing rainwater for later use—has the potential to help alleviate water stresses in rural and tribal communities in arid and semi-arid environments. This report is the companion to a [6 part video series on rainwater harvesting](https://native-climate.com/agriculture/rainwater-harvesting/). The code in this repository takes [climate data from PRISM Climate Group](https://prism.oregonstate.edu) and prepares those data for input into the [FAO's AquaCrop crop-water productivity model](https://www.fao.org/aquacrop/en/).
